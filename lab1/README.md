This is the solution to CMPE Lab1 taken by Prof Sithu Aung.

# High Level Algo

1. Retrieve the names of input files that need to be sorted.
2. Open and Sort the lists individually(with and without async).
3. Merge the lists into a final list.
4. Write the final list to file.
5. Measure the time taken by with and without async.

# Structure
Input: Contains all the unsorted_*.txt files.<\n>
Output: Contains the sorted.txt files - both with and without async.
